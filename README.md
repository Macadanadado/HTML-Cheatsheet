## General Info
  This project is meant to be a practice for html and css. The actual content of the webpage created is meant to be a basic overview of the html language.

## Technologies
  * HTML5
  * CSS

## Launch
  To open the website demo simply download the files to your desired file path and open up 'HTML & CSS Cheatsheet.html' in a browser.

## Status
  This project is still in progress. I hope to turn it into more of a reference page, rather than a descriptive page, for both html and css to be used later down the line.
