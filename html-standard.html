                    <h2 id='link'>Linking to External or Internal Webpages</h2>
                    <p>Linking to an external or an internal webpage uses the same concept of taking an anchor tag, &lt;a&gt;, and setting its href attribute to the url of the webpage if its external or its filepath if its internal. By using the &lt;target&gt; attribute and setting it equal to <span class='value'>'_blank'</span> then it will open the webpage in a new tab. It is also possible to link to a specific part on the current page by setting the <span class='attribute'>href</span> equal to the <span class='attribute'>id</span> of an element on the same page.</p>
